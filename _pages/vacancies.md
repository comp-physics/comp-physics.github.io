## Group openings

<div style="background-color: #252829; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #c0995e; margin: 20px 0;">
<strong>TL;DR – Who should contact us?</strong><br/>
• <strong>Ph.D. applicants</strong> (CSE or home-unit programs like AE/ME) who like HPC, numerics, and continuum physics<br/>
• <strong>Current GT Ph.D. students</strong> interested in exascale CFD or multiphase flows<br/>
• <strong>GT undergraduates</strong> (≥ 2 years left) with strong coding skills and interest in scientific computing<br/>
• We are <strong>not currently taking standalone M.S. students</strong>
</div>

In the Computational Physics Group, you will work on the latest methods in computational science for pressing societal problems.
Our work spans a broad range of 
* __Technical advancements:__ Modeling, design, numerical methods, simulation, algorithms, high-performance computing, non-von Neumann emerging architectures (quantum, RISC-V and Arm, etc.)
* __Application areas:__ Biology, medicine, and therapies, defense, aerodynamics, fluid dynamics, and flight, solid mechanics, hydrodynamics, energy

Check out <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/papers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our papers</a> to learn more.

__We are _always_ hiring determined new group members.__

If you are interested in joining the group, what to do next depends on who you are:

<div class="jumbotron">
#### I am interested in a Ph.D. from Georgia Tech

Excellent. In this case, you have two options:

1. Apply for the [CSE Ph.D. program](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-computational-science-and-engineering). If you do this, place my name in your faculty preference list (you get to pick two faculty). If this is you, I recommend _not_ emailing me, since I will see you application regardless. Feel free to email me if you have a special circumstance that was _not_ in your application, but you would like me know about or consider. However, I encourage you to include all relevant details in the application itself for transparency purposes.

2. Apply for a Ph.D. in a program where [CSE has a home unit](https://cse.gatech.edu/cse-home-units), like Aerospace or Mechanical Engineering. If you do this and are interested in working with me, _send me an [email](mailto:{{site.email}}) indicating the program you applied to, CV, and transcripts_.

If you are on the fence, I recommend applying for the CSE program, which is remarkably flexible regarding advising and course work.
</div>

<div class="jumbotron">
#### I am already a Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech

Fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/PhQYMbcAJKbhC83w9) **then** send Spencer [an email](mailto:{{site.email}}).
Include your current degree program, your year in that program, why you are interested in our group, your CV, current transcripts, and previous advisor(s).
</div>

<div class="jumbotron">
#### I am interested in an M.S. from Georgia Tech 

I am __not__ currently accepting Master's (M.S.) students or applications, from GT or elsewhere.
</div>

<div class="jumbotron">
#### I am an M.S. student at Georgia Tech 

If you are interested in a Georgia Tech Ph.D., follow the instructions under "I am already a Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech."
Otherwise, see "I am interested in an M.S. from Georgia Tech."
</div>

<div class="jumbotron">
#### I am, or am about to be, an undergraduate at Georgia Tech

The group has had numerous undergraduate researchers.
Many have published great work and I am very proud of what they have accomplished.
Continuing in this spirit, I am always open to working with keen undergraduate students.

* If you have _two years or more_ remaining in your degree program, fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/PhQYMbcAJKbhC83w9) **then** send Spencer [an email](mailto:{{site.email}}) indicating your matriculation year/semester, degree program, CV, transcripts, and what about the group you are interested in. Be as specific as possible.
* Note that I __do not__ start new projects with undergraduates with _less than two years_ remaining in their degree programs. The reason: There is unlikely to be enough time for you to fully _own and complete_ a project.

<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>

<strong>Should I email before applying?</strong><br/>
• <strong>Ph.D. applicants to CSE:</strong> No need to email—I'll see your application. Only email if you have special circumstances not covered in your application.<br/>
• <strong>Ph.D. applicants to home-unit programs (AE/ME):</strong> Yes, email me after applying with your program, CV, and transcripts.<br/>
• <strong>Current GT students:</strong> Fill out the form first, then email with all requested materials.

<strong>What should I include in my email?</strong><br/>
• Your CV, transcripts, and a brief explanation of why you're interested in the group<br/>
• For current GT students: your degree program, year, and previous advisor(s)

<strong>What counts as "2 years left" for undergraduates?</strong><br/>
You should have at least 4 semesters remaining (including the current one) before graduation. This ensures enough time to complete a meaningful research project.

<strong>Do you fund rotations or trial periods?</strong><br/>
We don't have formal rotation programs, but current GT students can discuss potential projects before committing.

<strong>What are typical timelines?</strong><br/>
• <strong>Ph.D. applications:</strong> Follow GT's application deadlines (typically December for Fall admission)<br/>
• <strong>Current GT students:</strong> Can join at any time, but earlier is better for project planning<br/>
• <strong>Undergraduates:</strong> Can start in any semester, but we prefer students who can commit for multiple semesters
