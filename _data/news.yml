https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2512.19507' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>available on arXiv</a>. Using direct numerical simulations and spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD), we quantify how incident acoustic energy is converted into vortical motion and viscous dissipation across sound pressure level, Strouhal number, and Reynolds number, identifying the coherent structures and mode-by-mode mechanisms that govern absorption. We show peak conversion near Keulegan-Carpenter number O(1) where boundary-layer separation and vortex shedding dominate damping, while higher frequencies reduce energy input via near-slit X-shaped modes and >99% of viscous loss remains confined near the slit mouth."
