I"ÿ'<h1 id="spencer-bryngelsons-website">Spencer Bryngelson‚Äôs website</h1>

<p><strong>Note: This webpage has been upgraded to use Jekyll plugins. If you are using Github pages you will have to build the website with the Rakefile in the project root directory! My Rakefile is adopted from ones like <a href="https://blog.sorryapp.com/blogging-with-jekyll/2014/01/31/using-jekyll-plugins-on-github-pages.html">this.</a></strong></p>

<p>This is my statically-generated Jekyll/Liquid/Bootstrap-based website.
I started with the <a href="https://www.allanlab.org/">Allan lab</a> webpage and modified it into a personal academic webpage that met my requirements.
I worked in a unique set of the features that I desired and could not find in publicly available templates elsewhere.
Some examples are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatically-generated buttons for DOI/PDF/ARXIV/BIB/Abstract information
    <ul>
      <li>via jekyll scholar</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bibliography information and abstracts open in drown down wells via buttons</li>
  <li>Fontawesome icons (email, CV, Google scholar, ResearchGate, GitHub, etc.)</li>
  <li>Dark color scheme via Bootswatch</li>
  <li>Consistent and attractive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">About me</code> page</li>
</ul>

<p>I encourage the use of this webpage as a template for your own academic website.
The remainder of this document describes how to do this.
Broadly speaking, there are three steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#fork-and-build">Fork</a></li>
  <li><a href="#customization">Customize</a></li>
  <li><a href="#hosting">Host</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fork-and-build">Fork and build</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fork <a href="https://github.com/sbryngelson/sbryngelson.github.io">this repository</a> by clicking the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fork</code> button in the top-right corner of its Github page.</li>
  <li>Install <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">Jekyll</a>  (version less than 4.0 required) on your local computer
    <ul>
      <li>On MacOS, you will need to upgrade your Ruby version from the depricated v2.3 that is shipped. Follow the above Jekyll instructions closely.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ bundle exec jekyll serve</code> in the repository root directory</li>
  <li>Your site is now hosted locally at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost:4000</code>, which you can access with your web browser.
    <ul>
      <li>It will be automatically re-built as you save changes to the files it contains.
 Refreshing your web browser reveals these changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> as appropriate</li>
  <li>Modify YAML database files, located in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_data/*.yml</code>, as appropriate</li>
  <li>Modify individual pages, located in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_pages/*.md</code>, as appropriate</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="navbar">Navbar</h3>

<p>The pages listed in the top navbar are located in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file.
The typical options are already included or commented, though additional pages can be created and listed here.</p>

<h3 id="creating-or-editing-pages">Creating or editing pages</h3>

<p>All pages are located in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_pages</code> directory.
Pages generally load information from YAML databases located as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_data/*.yml</code>.
Creating new pages can be done by using existing pages as a template.</p>

<h4 id="page-header-information">Page header information</h4>

<p>All pages require header information.
Example header data for the ‚ÄòTalks‚Äô page is below.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
title: "Talks"
layout: gridlay
sitemap: false
permalink: /talks/
---
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layout</code> variable corresponds to HTML layouts in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_layouts</code> directory.
The differences between most layouts is subtle and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gridlay</code> can generally be used.
The permalink must be unique for each page, and corresponds to the directory that will store the page in the compiled HTML.
Refer to your pages in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> variable.</p>

<h4 id="markdown">Markdown</h4>

<p>All pages are written in <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown</a> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.md</code>.
HTML commands and CSS styles can be directly used in a markdown files.</p>

<h4 id="publication-page-and-database">Publication page and database</h4>

<p>The publications and talks are now listed via Jekyll Scholar.
The bibliography file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ref.bib</code> is located in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cv/</code> directory.
Modify according to your needs.</p>

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>

<p>Once your site has been modified to fit your needs, you should host it somewhere so others can access it.</p>

<h3 id="github-pages">Github pages</h3>

<p>A simple way to host your site for free is via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.
This will provide you a free domain name at your_github_username.github.io.
Instructions on how to do this are available on their page.
They generally involve creating a repository on your Github titled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">your_github_username.github.io</code> and uploading your files there (everything excepted the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site/</code> directory, which the Github Pages service will generate using its own version of Jekyll).
Then, Github will automatically rebuild your site every time you push a commit to the repository (no bundle/jekyll commands required).</p>

<h3 id="custom-domain-names">Custom domain names</h3>

<p>You can use a standard domain service (e.g. <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>) to purchase a domain name.
Then, using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CNAME</code> file and modifying the DNS settings of the domain service, you can direct your custom domain to the Github Pages-generated site.
Detailed instructions for doing this for GoDaddy domains are available <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-set-up-godaddy-domain-with-github-pages-a9300366c7b">here</a>, though analogous instructions apply to other services.</p>

<h3 id="hosting-elsewhere">Hosting elsewhere</h3>

<p>If you already have a hosting service for a static HTML webpage, such as some universities provide, you can build your website locally using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code>.
Then, upload the resulting files located in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site/</code> directory via SSH or FTP to this server.
Be sure that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site.url</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site.baseurl</code> are set appropriately in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>

<h3 id="static-website-generators">Static website generators</h3>

<p>A list of static webpage generators is available <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">here</a>.
For academic purposes, I believe most people use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.
I am mostly unaware of their relative merits.
However, both are relatively easy to use and offer many templates to base your ideas off of.
This, in combination with their large user bases, make them particularly attractive.
This site is built with Jekyll.</p>

<h3 id="templates">Templates</h3>

<p>Other Jekyll templates are of course available.
Some of these are viable for very simple academic pages with little tuning:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal mistakes</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://academicpages.github.io/">academicpages</a></li>
</ul>

<p>However, they do not natively include many of the features I list at the top.
For this reason, I decided to build my own theme.</p>
