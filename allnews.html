  <p>Spencer is working with DOE lab collaborators as a Visiting Professor at <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/quantum-information-sciences" taret="_blank">PNNL</a> on a potential quantum advantage for simulating CFD problems. Ph.D. student Zhixin Song spent the summer collaborating with PNNL on this front as well!</p>

  <p>Our work on parsimonious IMR (pIMR) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D5SM00397K" target="_blank">has now appeared in <i>Soft Matter!</i></a> It describes and demonstrates a scheme for high-fidelity material inference that reduces the cost of experimentation or simulation by two orders of magnitude. With this, we enable material characterization in tractable time. In collaboration with Michigan, Brown, and UT Austin.</p>

  <p><b>29 July, 2025</b></p>

  <p>Florian Schäfer and I are presenting our collaborative work on computational fluid dynamics via IGR in back-to-back talks at the joint SIAM/CAIMS Annual Meeting tomorrow in Montreal, Wed July 30. <a href="https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=85319" target="_blank">Link Here.</a></p>

  <p><b>24 July, 2025</b></p>

  <p>Our group, in collaboration with Florian Schäfer, <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/2025/07/23/shock-treatment-for-cfd-simulations/" target="_blank">was featured in Oak Ridge News</a> for our record-setting compressible shock-laden CFD simulations. They exceeded <b>100 trillion grid points</b> while maintaining speed and accuracy via mixed-precision, unified memory addressing on the CPU-GPU interconnect, and information geometric regularization. These simulations targeted multi-rocket-engine outflow at Mach 15. These conditions and the geometry are similar to the SpaceX Starship superheavy 33-rocket booster.</p>
